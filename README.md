# DECA labs in SystemVerilog

This repository contains my DECA labs from 1st year EIE @ Imperial College London in SystemVerilog rather than Issie.

You should not take this as an educational resource. I am still a beginner to SystemVerilog, so do not expect this to be a role model for how SystemVerilog should be written.
